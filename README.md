course project
This is for the project in the Coursera course "Getting and cleaning data".
The R script "run_analysis.R" has the code that does the following work:
1. Download the zip data set file from the URL if it exists.
2. Unzip the file
3. read all the dataset tables.
4. Merge train dataset and test dataset together to get one dataset 
5. Clean the data and get a subset with only the mean and standard deviation for each variable
6. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
7. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
8. From the subset dataset obtained, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
9. Save the final tidy data set as "Tidy.txt".
